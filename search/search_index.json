During an analysis process, the components in the pipeline are executed one after another annotating documents. Pipelines do not interact with the input data directly but build the structure for an NLP workflow.</p> <p>Creating a pipeline with this web-interface can be done in the Builder. It is a three-step form that guides you through building a pipeline either from scratch or  using a template as the starting point.</p> <p>Choosing a template as a starting point copies all predefined settings into a fresh pipeline.</p> <p>In the second step pipeline specific properties like name, description, tags and settings can be edited.  Only a name is required to proceed but adding a short description is recommended to serve as documentation  and help others when sharing a pipeline. Tags can help document and find pipelines in the Dashboard.</p>"},{"location":"#component","title":"Component","text":"<p>Components are the part of DUUI that actually do the processing and therefore offer the most settings. When creating a pipeline you can choose from a set of predefined components or create your own. Once added to the pipeline, a component can be edited by clicking the  icon. This will open a drawer on the right, that allows for modification of a component.</p> <p>Settings include:</p> <p>Name</p> <p>Driver \u2014 The Driver is responsible for the instantiation   of a component during a process.</p> <p>Target \u2014 The component's target depends on the selected driver. For Docker, Kubernetes and Swarm Drivers, the target is the full image name. For UIMA it is the class path to the Annotator represented by this component and for a Remote Driver the URL has to be specified.</p> <p>Tags </p> <p>Description </p> <p>Options </p> <p>Parameters</p> <p>Options are specific to the selected driver. Most of the time the default options are sufficient and modifications are only for special uses cases. Parameters are useful if the component requires settings that are not controlled by DUUI.</p> <p>When editing a specific pipeline, clicking the  icon clones the component's settings and prefills the creation form.</p>"},{"location":"#process","title":"Process","text":"<p>A process manages the flow of data and pipeline execution.

This complexity is increased by the fact that flexible, extensible text analysis requires the continuous integration of ever new tools. Since there are no adequate frameworks for these purposes in the field of NLP, and especially in the context of UIMA, that are not outdated or unusable for security reasons, we present a new approach to address the latter task: Docker Unified UIMA Interface (DUUI), a scalable, flexible, lightweight, and feature-rich framework for automatic distributed analysis of text corpora that leverages Big Data experience and virtualization with Docker. We evaluate DUUI{'}s communication approach against a state-of-the-art approach and demonstrate its outstanding behavior in terms of time efficiency, enabling the analysis of big text data.\",\n}\n</code></pre> [LINK] [PDF] </p>"},{"location":"javadoc/legal/jquery/","title":"Jquery","text":""},{"location":"javadoc/legal/jquery/#jquery-v371","title":"jQuery v3.7.1","text":""},{"location":"javadoc/legal/jquery/#jquery-license","title":"jQuery License","text":"<pre><code>jQuery v 3.7.1\nCopyright OpenJS Foundation and other contributors, https://openjsf.org/\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
