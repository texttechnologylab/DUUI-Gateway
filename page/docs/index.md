### About
The **Docker Unified UIMA Interface â€“ Gateway** (**DUUI-Gateway** for short) is a web and REST-based software solution for encapsulating and utilising the [Docker Unified UIMA Interface](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/DockerUnifiedUIMAInterface), a Big Data NLP framework for the automatic processing of heterogeneous NLP tools, based on UIMA and using microservices such as Docker or Kubernetes.

**DUUI** as well as **DUUI-Gateway** are developed and maintained at the **Texttechnologylab** ([TTLab](https://www.texttechnologylab.org/)) at the Goethe University Frankfurt.


## Introduction

Automatic analysis of large text corpora is a complex task. This complexity particularly concerns the question of time efficiency. Furthermore, efficient, flexible, and extensible textanalysis requires the continuous integration of every new text analysis tools. Since there are currently, in the area of NLP and especially in the application context of UIMA, only very few to no adequate frameworks for these purposes, which are not simultaneously outdated or can no longer be used for security reasons, this work will present a new approach to fill this gap.

DUUI-Gateway is a tool that completely encapsulates DUUI and allows its use in a functional web interface as well as by integrating an API.
